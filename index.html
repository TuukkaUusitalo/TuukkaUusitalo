        <p>For me, happiness and inner satisfaction come from achieving goals that matter to me and working hard to
            fulfill them. I consider myself highly entrepreneurial and believe that starting a company is one of the
            best ways to change things around us and create value in society. I want my work and projects to have
            purpose, and I feel that learning to code is an essential step toward pursuing my dreams and building
            something meaningful in the society.</p>

        <p>The platform economy is highly multidimensional and represents the area of digitalization that has created
            the most value in the 21st century. I believe we are still only at the beginning of its development, and it
            will continue to transform our societies and lives even more. For example, home food delivery is expected to
            grow manifold in the coming decades. And what about other online retailers and entirely new service
            providers? This is an area that fascinates me, and I hope to be part of that change — as an entrepreneur.</p>

                <p>At the moment, one of the biggest goals I have is to build a native mobile application. It would be a
                    consumer app that people would use in their everyday life. I want it to be scalable and also to look
                    great for the users. If you want to hear more,

                <p>I believe in path dependence. Everything you do, succeed and fail can be a lesson and preparation
                    for the future.The more you do things and fail, the luckier you get! Afterwards everything seems
                    obvious or logical, but you don't know what's to come. So grow your experience base, do as
                    many things as possible, and the further you will go on your path!</p>

                <p>Entrepreneurship is a way to change things in society. It is also a way to fulfill myself. I'm
                    dreaming of a good team to start a company with. Today, my role models are many Finnish game
                    industry entrepreneurs, and of course also the Wolt team.</p>
